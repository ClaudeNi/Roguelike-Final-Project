# Final Project

This is a 2 week final project where I will be building a 2D roguelike game inside React, and including a save system through the backend.

## Info
What is a roguelike game? A roguelike game is a turn based dungeon crawler where the goal is to survive as many floors as you can.  
  
With the help of the [Rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) npm, I was able to build a roguelike game with both ASCII art and 2D pixel art that I drew myself.  
  
When you visit the site, you are greeted with a simple login/register page, where you have the title of the game and that's it.

After logging in, you arrive at the title screen, where you can start a new game, load game if you already have a save or just simply exit the game.

After opening the game, the first thing you see is the ASCII art style but you have the opportunity to change the style between ASCII and 2D pixel art.
